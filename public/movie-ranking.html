   <h1>Movies That Move Us</h1>

   <h2>A list of movies that inspire and instigate</h2>
  
   <hr/>
  
   <p>
      During the last century, cinema and television have become the most widely consumed art form. From superhero action 
      movies to sappy romantic comedies, from explorative animation pieces to avant-garde experimental cinema, movies as an art
      medium have reigned supreme. Every year, thousands of new cinematographic projects are released worlwide. Some movies go on
      to become blockbuster, surpassing all expectations! Some become viral sensations, sparking social media interests for 
      months to come! Others... not so much. Not all movies can be groundbreaking. Yet, occasionally, something truly special 
      comes along. Every now and then, a movie is more than a viral sensation: it is a piece of art for the ages.

      But what makes a movie spectacular? Is it the combination of beautiful special effects with a superb wardrobe and scenery
      department? Or the magnificent interplay of an actor's expertise with a raw, powerful script? Is it the courage to try
      something new? To speak truth to power? Or is deciding what makes a movie great a completely subjective metric, relative
      only to our resonance to the piece? Tough to say. Yet, here are a few movies that have moved the hearts of critics and
      audiences alike.

   <h3>1. The Lord of The Rings: Return of The King</h3>
   <p>
      The conclussion to Peter Jackson's masterful trilogy, this epic movie manages to elevate Tolkien's work with a satisfying
      finale to Frodo's journey to destroy The One Ring. A tale of friendship, courage, and honor is well served by its 
      well-known soundtrack and stunning visuals.

   <h3>2. Forest Gump</h3>
   <p>
      Much like Tom Hanks' eponymous character, this movie stands the test of time almost half a century after its release.
      A deceptively profound character exploration takes the viewer through the mid-to-late 1900s history of the United States,
      exploring love, war, and life moving always forward.

   <h3>3. To Kill a Mockingbird</h3>
   <p>
      A classic tale of innocence, youth, and social stygma, To Kill a Mockingbird has a way of bringing us back to a simpler 
      time and, unfortunately, to remind us that there is a long way to go to fix the social injustices and prejudices that
      we learn along the way.
